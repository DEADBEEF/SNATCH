\subsection{Workflow and Data Management}
Geographic Information Science involves the capture, storage, manipulation and analysis
and management of geographic data. This data is very diverse and as such has to be handled
in quite diverse ways. This data gets abstracted into various forms. This presents a
rather unique challenge in managing the data as it could be used by anyone of the research
staff at any point in the process. This data movement is laborious and could benefit from
from automisation.

Workflow Management Systems aim to decompose compilated projects and processes into
small atomic chucks. This decompisition can then be optimised to improve the efficiency.
GIS research projects are generally done with multiperson teams where the work is
done in a parallel fashion. Under these conditions workflow management systems
are optimal.

The aim is to provide a workflow management that is applicable for GIS projects.
This system should be able to: interface with the current systems; track and
manage the workflow; provide local data availabilty and content delivery; and
increases overall efficiency within the dicipline.
