\section{Project Description}
The Zamani project, started by the UCT Department of Geomatics, aims to preserve African cultural heritage by documenting heritage sites and producing laser scanned models.
\section{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Architectural Model Streaming}
The UCT Department of Geomatics has indicated that they have difficulties handling the size of some of their models. These laser scanned models of cultural heritage sites are often very large, some of them containing over 8 billion points. Given this vast scale of data, traditional viewing methods and the current hardware and software systems are not able to cope.  Consequently, before viewing or manipulating the data, one must go through a process of decimating the original data by a factor of 10, 100 or more. This compromise is often unacceptable, as one may often require the full original detail. This level of detail is often necessary for cultural heritage sites in order to view details such as cracks and flaws, with a view to preserving the site and preventing damage.
\subsection{Workflow and Data Management}
Geographic Information Science involves the capture, storage, manipulation and analysis
and management of geographic data. This data is very diverse and as such has to be handled
in quite diverse ways. This data gets abstracted into various forms. This presents a
rather unique challenge in managing the data as it could be used by anyone of the research
staff at any point in the process. This data movement is laborious and could benefit from
from automisation.

Workflow Management Systems aim to decompose compilated projects and processes into
small atomic chucks. This decompisition can then be optimised to improve the efficiency.
GIS research projects are generally done with multiperson teams where the work is
done in a parallel fashion. Under these conditions workflow management systems
are optimal.

The aim is to provide a workflow management that is applicable for GIS projects.
This system should be able to: interface with the current systems; track and
manage the workflow; provide local data availabilty and content delivery; and
increases overall efficiency within the dicipline.

\section{Procedures and Methods}
\subsection{Hierarchical Data Structure}

\section{Ethical, Professional and Legal Issues}
At this point we see no legal/ethical issues

\section{Anticipated Outcomes}
\section{Project Plan}
\subsection{Risks}
\subsubsection*{Network Constraints}
\subsubsection*{Middleware}
For this project to be successful, the WFMS it would have to interface
heavily with existing software used to perform
\subsubsection*{Hardware Limitations}
\subsubsection*{Large Indices}
When indexing the models we will have to generate a significant amount of data. Given that many of the models are already very large, these indices might become unfeasibly large. Dealing with such large indexes will be an important part of the project and we will have to deal with this risk.
\subsubsection*{Integration with Existing GIS Software}
The hierarchical datastructure required as part of this project aims to facilitate level of detail streaming and realtime interaction. However, ideally one should not have to re-implement tools which are already available such as ArcGIS. We aim to integrate our datastructure into a pre-existing software package to prevent unnecessary work. However, this may be difficult and there are several associated risks such as, unavailability of source code, lack of documenation for the software, and potential copyright license infringement.
\subsubsection*{Implementation Difficulties}

We need a nice program for creating Gantt charts
