    abstract = {{The way information is stored, retrieved and displayed is changing. Simple
bibliographic databases are giving way to unregulated and unorganized
multimedia data repositories, which can give the user great difficulty when
searching for information. A methodology is needed to keep all of this
information in its various forms retrievable. This is the first modern survey
of the field of information storage and retrieval to discuss how to work with
information in all its varying forms. It shows information professionals how
to handle full-text, graphics, video and audio, and how to distribute these
massive databases over networks. Contents same as US/UK editions.}},
