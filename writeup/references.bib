bibliographic databases are giving way to unregulated and unorganized
multimedia data repositories, which can give the user great difficulty when
searching for information. A methodology is needed to keep all of this
information in its various forms retrievable. This is the first modern survey
of the field of information storage and retrieval to discuss how to work with
information in all its varying forms. It shows information professionals how
to handle full-text, graphics, video and audio, and how to distribute these
massive databases over networks. Contents same as US/UK editions.}},

Some activities, such as data analysis, search, and simulation, can be accelerated by letting scientists write workflows and scripts that automate routine activities. These capture pieces of the scientific method that scientists can share. The Taverna Workbench, a widely deployed scientific-workflow-management system, together with the myExperiment social Web site for sharing scientific experiments, follow six principles of designing software for adoption by scientists and six principles of user engagement.},

abstract={Grid workflow authoring tools are typically specific to particular workflow engines built into grid middleware, or are application specific and are designed to interact with specific software implementations. g-Eclipse is a middleware independent grid workbench that aims to provide a unified abstraction of the grid and includes a grid workflow builder to allow users to author and deploy workflows to the grid. This paper describes the g-Eclipse Workflow Builder and its implementations for two grid middlewares, gLite and GRIA, and a case study utilizing the workflow builder in a grid user's scientific workflow deployment.},

   abstract = {Large design and manufacturing projects are conducted in elaborate settings. Interdependent specialists work together, building complex systems. A substantial part of their daily work concerns the coordination of distributed work. This paper reports from a field study at Foss Electric, a Danish manufacturing company, where the development of an instrument for testing the quality of raw milk was studied. Scheduled and informal project meetings together with paper-based coordination systems were the primary means of managing the complexity of coordinating work within the project. This paper investigates the origination, use, and function of these coordination mechanisms applying a Coordination Mechanism perspective (Schmidt and Simone, 1996). We argue that the complexity of coordinating distributed work in large design projects result in the adoption of coordination systems. These systems formalize aspects of coordination work through artifacts, procedures for use and conventions.},
