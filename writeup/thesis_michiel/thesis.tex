\begin{abstract}
Workflow Management Systems have been highly successful in managing complicated
tasks and procedures, both for business and scientific applications. This
research project follows the development of an \emph{Automatic Workflow System}
designed to meet the needs of the tasks that are present within the
\emph{Zamani Project}. This is developed to handle very large files, which is a
common within the project. The system was developed in three design iterations
built from the requirements and considerations of the group. A Web interface
is used to control the system. The system was built in Python using the \emph{Django}
framework along with JQuery and other front-end libraries.

Both automated and user tasks are supported in the system. For user tasks, the
required files are automatically copied to the user's workstation. This is done
using \emph{rsync} to reduce transfer times; as well as protect effectively
against network failure that can occur. Once the task has been completed, the
transfer process is initiated in the opposite direction. To improve
the quality of the work, all user tasks require being validated by senior
members on the team. Simple error recovery was built into the system, allowing
users to inspect the logging information to determine the cause of the failure,
allowing the tasks to be restarted as soon as the problem has been alleviated.

The system was evaluated by implementing a subsection of the Zamani tasks.
These tasks were successfully completed within the system. A User
Experience evaluation was conducted that shows that users  were
satisfied with the system. It was also found that the system was easy to use and
easy to learn.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}
First of all I would like to thank my supervisor in the project, Dr Hussein
Suleman. Your advice and leadership was instrumental throughout this entire
project. Thank you so much for the early mornings spent reviewing drafts and the
advice given when I had no idea of the direction that I needed to go in. Your
ability to keep conversation interesting helped me keep my sanity through this
process. For that I thank you.

To the National Research Foundation(NRF), thank you for the financial assistance
given towards this degree and in particular the project. This made the process
a lot more comfortable and enjoyable.

To the members of the Zamani Project I
interacted with: Professor Heinz Ruther, Stephan Wessels and Ralf Schroeder,
thank you for the time and effort that you put in to help make this project
possible. The use of your data is highly appreciated and valued. A special thank
to Roshan Bhurtha, who was my main point of contact within the team. Thank you
for the quick responses when I had any queries.

To my project partner, Tim: thanks for being one of the most exceptional people I
have ever met. I really look up to you. Your intelligence is only matched by
your kindness. Thank you for an amazing year and I will treasure your friendship
always. To the rest of the CS Honours class of 2012, it has been a great
experience getting to know you guys; sharing in both the fun and hard times.
A special thank you to Simba Nyatsanga and Marco Lawrence, for
the long nights spent in the laboratory, the food runs, the jokes, the emotional
support. Thank you for making this project enjoyable. To Kaitlyn Crawford and
Henk Joubert, thank you for being the exceptional people you are. Your friendship
during this year has been great. I look forward to working with you next year.

Lastly, I would like to thank my parents: John and Wilma Baird. Without you I
literally would not have been here. Thank you for all the support, both
emotionally and financially. It was quite convenient being able to phone you up
at 3am in the mornings. Thank you for being the best parents anyone could ask
for. I am extremely proud to be called your son. I love you, and I will always
strive to make you proud.
