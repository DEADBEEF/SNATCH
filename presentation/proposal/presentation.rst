Zamani Project
--------------

* Started by the UCT Department of Geomatics in 2004
* Aims to preserve cultural heritage by documenting sites
  and producing laser scanned models
* Over 100 models of sites in various African countries including
  South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Tanzania
* Some of the models are very large and contain billions of points

Problems Faced
--------------

* Fast-growing volume of data
* Difficulty in storing the data
* Difficulty with viewing the large models in real-time
* Data locality issues
* Large number of users interact with the data

----

Solution Approach
-----------------

* To enable viewing of the large 3D models at interactive frame
  rates we will implement a hierachical multi-resolution data
  structure
* A server with a large amount of storage will be procured; this will
  be used to store the models and GIS data, and support the core 
  functionalities of the solution.


----

Division of Work
----------------

* Tim will be implementing the hierachical datastructure to enable
  real-time interaction with the large 3D models.
* Michiel will be implementing a Scientific workbench that is
  specialised for GIS research. This will pay special attention
  to data movement and intergration with existing GIS tools.
