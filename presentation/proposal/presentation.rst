Zamani Project
--------------

* Started by the UCT Department of Geomatics in 2004
* Aims to preserve cultural heritage by documenting sites
  and producing laser scanned models
* Over 100 models of sites in various African countries including
  South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Tanzania
* Some of the models are very large and contain billions of points

----

Problems Faced
--------------

* Fast-growing volume of data
* Difficulty in storing the data
* Difficulty with viewing the large models in real-time
* Data locality issues
* Large number of users interact with the data

----

Solution Approach
-----------------

* To enable viewing of the large 3D models at interactive frame
  rates we will implement a hierachical multi-resolution data
  structure
* A server with a large amount of storage will be procured; this will
  be used to store the models and GIS data, and support the core
  functionalities of the solution.


----

Division of Work
----------------

* Tim will be implementing the hierachical datastructure to enable
  real-time interaction with the large 3D models.
* Michiel will be implementing a Scientific workbench that is
  specialised for GIS research. This will pay special attention
  to data movement and intergration with existing GIS tools.

----

Dynamic Viewing of Large 3D Models
----------------------------------

* The Department of Geomatics has indicated that they have difficulties
  handling the sizes of some of their models
* Some of the models they are dealing with contain over 8 billion points
* At this point, traditional viewing methods cannot cope; the resolution
  of the original model must be decreased manually beforehand
* This compromise is often unacceptable


----

Research Question
-----------------

* Is it feasible to support real time viewing of models containing
  billions of points?
* Answering this question in the affirmative would enable exploration
  of the Zamani models in their full detail
* It would have a significant impact in the Geomatics department

Proposed Solution
-----------------

* Implement a multi-resolution data structure to divide our model into
  manageable chunks
* Initially only a subset of the points is available
* As one zooms into the model and greater detail is required, we dynamically
  fetch additional points from our data structure until the full original
  detail is available

----

Relevant Literature
-------------------

* Common approaches to structuring large 3D models include octrees,
  R-trees, bounding sphere hierachies, and Hilbert Space Filling
  Curves

| Data Structure            | Largest model rendered | Reference                      |
+===========================+========================+================================+
| Bounding Sphere Hierachy  | 8 million points       | (Rusinkiewicz and Levoy, 2000) |
+---------------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Hierarchy of Tetrahedra   | 300 million points     | (Cigoni et al., 2008)          |
+---------------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Octree                    | 2.2 billion points     | (Wand et al., 2007)            |

Proposed Datastructure
----------------------

* From researching the literature it seems that octrees have the best
  performance
* All data is stored in the leaf nodes
* Inner nodes provide simplified multi-resolution representations
* No leaf node should contain more than a specified number of points
* Empirically, it seems that a value of around 30,000 gives good performance

Evaluation Criteria
-------------------

* Can the system render the largest of the Zamani models at interactive
  frame rates?
* If this goal is achieved the system will be a success
* Varying degrees of success can also be determined by testing smaller
  models of varying sizes

Workbench - Michiel
-------------------

How effective is an automated workflow solution in GIS context?

.. image :: projectDiagram.png


----

Previous work
-------------

* Various fields of science has adopted and implemented
  workflow systems
* These systems have increased efficiency and research output
* GIS research has been shown to be applicable to an automated
  workflow system; this has not however been implemented

----

Proposed Solution
-----------------

* Use an existing workflow system as various platforms already
  exist
* Design a workflow that is applicable to GIS
* Write middleware to integrate with existing GIS tools
* Software that automatically transfers data as it is needed down
  the pipeline

----

Testing Criteria
----------------

* How much does the content delivery system decrease waiting time?
* How effective is the workflow system based on the analytics that
  will be generated be the system.

Deliverables
------------

* GIS workbench
* Middleware for core functionalities
* Data Flow Facilitator
* Hierarchical Data Structure
* Streaming Infrastucture
